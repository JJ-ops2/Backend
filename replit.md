# Overview

This is a Community Service Tracker web application built with Flask that manages student volunteer hours, staff oversight, and achievement recognition. The application tracks community service hours for students, allows staff to log and confirm hours, and provides a leaderboard system with milestone-based accolades (10, 25, 50 hours). It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and provides a REST API with JWT-based authentication.

# System Architecture

## Web Framework & Structure

**Problem**: Need a scalable, maintainable structure for a Flask web application
**Solution**: Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern implementation
- **Models** (`App/models/`): Database entities using SQLAlchemy ORM with polymorphic inheritance (User → Student, Staff)
- **Views** (`App/views/`): Blueprint-based route handlers separated by domain (auth, student, staff, user)
- **Controllers** (`App/controllers/`): Business logic layer that mediates between models and views

**Rationale**: MVC separation ensures single responsibility principle, makes testing easier, and allows components to evolve independently.

## Authentication & Authorization

**Problem**: Secure user authentication with role-based access control
**Solution**: Flask-JWT-Extended with cookie and header-based tokens
- JWT tokens store user ID in the 'sub' claim
- Polymorphic user types (student vs staff) enable role-based authorization
- Token stored in both cookies and headers for flexibility
- Custom user loader retrieves User objects from JWT identity

**Design Choice**: Password hashing via Werkzeug's `generate_password_hash`/`check_password_hash` for security.

## Data Layer

**Problem**: Persistent storage of user data, hours tracking, and accolades
**Solution**: Flask-SQLAlchemy with polymorphic inheritance pattern
- **User** base model with polymorphic identity discriminator
- **Student** extends User with hours tracking and accolade relationships
- **Staff** extends User with administrative capabilities
- **Accolade** separate entity linked to students via foreign key

**Alternatives Considered**: 
- Single table with nullable fields → Rejected due to poor normalization
- Separate tables without inheritance → Rejected due to code duplication

**Trade-offs**: Polymorphic inheritance adds complexity but provides clean code reuse and type safety.

## Database Schema Design

- **Users/Students/Staff**: Single-table inheritance with discriminator column (`user_type`)
- **Accolades**: One-to-many relationship with cascade delete to maintain referential integrity
- **Hours Tracking**: Integer field on Student model with automatic accolade milestone detection

## API Design

**Problem**: Provide programmatic access to application features
**Solution**: RESTful API with JSON responses
- Consistent endpoint naming (`/api/students`, `/api/staff`)
- HTTP verb semantics (GET for retrieval, POST for actions)
- JWT required on protected endpoints via `@jwt_required()` decorator
- Error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes

**Endpoints Structure**:
- Authentication: `/api/login`
- Student operations: `/api/students/*`, `/api/students/me`
- Staff operations: `/api/staff/*`, `/api/staff/log-hours`
- Leaderboard: `/api/students/leaderboard`

## Testing Strategy

**Problem**: Ensure code quality and prevent regressions
**Solution**: Multi-layer testing approach
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual model methods and business logic in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test controller functions with database interactions
- **API Tests**: Test complete request/response cycles via pytest fixtures
- Test database isolation using SQLite in-memory or separate test.db

**Implementation**: pytest framework with fixtures for database setup/teardown per test module.

## CLI Commands

**Problem**: Database initialization and administrative tasks
**Solution**: Flask CLI with Click framework
- `flask init`: Database schema creation and sample data seeding
- Custom command groups for students and staff management
- Promotes infrastructure-as-code for deployment

## Frontend Architecture

**Problem**: Serve both traditional web pages and SPA-style interfaces
**Solution**: Hybrid approach
- Jinja2 templates for server-side rendering (`/users`)
- Static HTML + JavaScript for client-side rendering (`/static/users`)
- Materialize CSS framework for responsive UI

**Rationale**: Provides flexibility for different use cases while maintaining consistent styling.

## Production Deployment

**Problem**: Serve application in production environment
**Solution**: Gunicorn WSGI server with gevent workers
- Async worker type for handling concurrent requests
- Configurable worker count (currently 4)
- Bind to 0.0.0.0:8080 for container/cloud compatibility
